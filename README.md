My recipe is about probably the most loved noodles all over the world. It is on Maggi. Maggi already comes with a recipe but I think mine is a better version to make it. There are mainly 2 ways to eat it- soupy and dry. My favourite is the dry version. Most of these quantities vary based on your taste but mainly the taste is the same. The ingredients I am going to tell you are both for the dry and soupy ones just follow the quantities for what you want.
