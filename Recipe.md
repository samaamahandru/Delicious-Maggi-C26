Start with boiling the water
After 1 min add the masala 
After 3 mins add the Maggi Noodles
After 1 min add the butter
After 3-5 mins your Maggi should be ready
If you wish for your Maggi to be drier add a bit more butter

Super easy and simple! Just find an amazing book to read or movie to watch while eating or simply enjoy the taste of Maggi ;) 
Bon appetit!! :)
